Code examples that I use for tutoring C++.

The intent of this tutorial is to give a quick overview of some of the most
important and interesting features of C++, including new additions in the
latest revision of the language (C++17 at the point of writing this). It is
assumed that you already know how to program and are familiar with
object-oriented design.

Disclaimer
------------
The examples presented here are meant to highlight (and sometimes exploit) the
specifics and quirks of the language. To this end, the presented examples may
exhibit undefined or implementation specific behaviour, or implement solutions
that are against good coding practices. This is done for educational purposes
only!

Status
--------
**WORK-IN-PROGRESS**

Platform Support
--------
The only requirement for **cpp-tutor** is a C++17 compliant compiler. It is
supported on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows and regularly tested on the following
configurations (extracted from the CI files: `.travis.yml` and `appveyor.yml`):
  * Linux Ubuntu 16.04 (GCC-7 and LLVM-7)
  * Windows (Visual Studio 2015)
  * Mac OS X 10.13 (Apple LLVM 10)

Please refer to the instructions

Build Instructions
--------
It is assumed that **cpp-tutor** will be built in `<build-dir>` and that the
top-level source directory is `<source-dir>`. For brevity, the build
instructions are presented for Linux only.

First, you will need to clone Google Test inside `<source-dir>`:
```
$ cd <source_dir>
$ git clone https://github.com/abseil/googletest.git
```

Next, you can build as follows:
```
$ cd <build-dir>
$ cmake <source_dir>
$ make
```
This will generate all the targets implemented for this project.
