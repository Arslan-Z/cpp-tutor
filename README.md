Code examples for tutoring modern C++.

The intent of this tutorial is to give a quick overview of some of the most
important and interesting features of C++, and to do so in a form of complete
and self-contained examples. It focuses on modern C++ (C++11/C++14/C++17), but
there are also some pre C++11 and C-specific examples for comparison. It's by
no means complete - quite the contrary. It aim is to be:
  * **Concise**: the examples are short, yet complete - to the point. There's a
    source file implementing a `main` function for each item and you can study it
    in complete isolation from other items.
  * **Selective**: the examples emphasise features and corner cases most likely
    encountered when _just_ starting with modern C++. They focus on key points
    rather then presenting the complete picture. Less is more.
  * **Clear**: the examples sacrifice code quality in favour of code clarity
    and readability, e.g. in some cases there's more comments than code. Also,
    see the [disclaimer](#disclaimer)

It is assumed that you already:
  * know some basic C++
  * are familiar with object-oriented programming

The code samples presented here will be helpful if you're switching to C++ from a
different object oriented language, are preparing for an interview, or, like
myself, are mentoring junior C++ developers.

Disclaimer
----------
The examples presented here are meant to highlight (and sometimes exploit) the
specifics and quirks of the language. To this end, the presented examples may
exhibit undefined or implementation specific behaviour, or implement solutions
that are against good coding practices. This is done for educational purposes
only and always thoroughly documented.

Status
------
**WORK-IN-PROGRESS**

Platform Support
----------------
The only requirement for **cpp-tutor** is a C++17 compliant compiler. It is
supported on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows and is regularly tested against the
following configurations (extracted from the CI files: `.travis.yml` and
`appveyor.yml`):
  * Linux Ubuntu 16.04 (GCC-7 and LLVM-7)
  * Windows (Visual Studio 2015)
  * Mac OS X 10.13 (Apple LLVM 10)

Locally I used GCC-8.2.1 and LLVM-7 for development. Please refer to the CI
logs (links at the top of the page) for reference setups.

Usage
-----
The [items](#tems) discussed here are independent and you can study them in any
order that works for you. Once you choose an item that's of interest to you, go
through the links and code samples available here. Next,
[build](#build-instructions) and run it.  Most binary files print to `stdout`.
Make sure that you understand where the output comes from, what it means that
and that it matches the comments in the code.

Some examples implement undefined behaviour, contain compiler errors or code
that leads to memory leaks. Such _broken_ parts of the code are guarded off
with two preprocessor symbolic constants:
  * `COMPILATION_ERROR`
  * `MEMORY_LEAK`

Be default both constants are undefined and hence there are neither compilation
errors nor memory leaks. Play around by defining them (one at a time),
recompiling and re-running the examples. Make sure that the generated output
(or compiler errors) make sense. Comments in the corresponding source files
might be instrumental in understanding those.

You can (and should) use [Valgrind](http://valgrind.org/) to get a better
grasp of memory leaks implemented in some of the examples, e.g.:
```
$ cd <build_dir>
$ valgrind smart_pointers
```
(`<build_dir>` is the build directory used when [building](#build-instructions)
the project). Remember to re-build and run `Valgrind`  _before_ and _after_
defining `MEMORY_LEAK`.

Build Instructions
------------------
It is assumed that **cpp-tutor** will be built in `<build-dir>` and that the
top-level source directory is `<source-dir>`. For brevity, the build
instructions are presented for Linux only.

First, you will need to clone Google Test inside `<source-dir>`:
```
$ cd <source_dir>
$ git clone https://github.com/abseil/googletest.git
```

Next, you can build all the examples as follows:
```
$ cd <build-dir>
$ cmake <source_dir>
$ make
```
This will generate all the targets implemented for this project. If you want to
(re-)build a particular example, run:
```
$ make <example_name>
```
In order to define either `COMPILATION_ERROR` or `MEMORY_LEAK`, re-run CMake:
```
$ cmake -DCOMPILATION_ERROR=1 .
```
This will update `<build_dir>/include/cpp_tutor.h`, which is auto-generated by
CMake.
